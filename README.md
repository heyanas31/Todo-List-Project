# Tasks organizer application: 
It is DSA-related Project. 

# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create and execute a To-Do List application that utilizes sophisticated data structures and algorithms for effective task management. In addition to standard functions like adding, removing, and editing tasks, this application will also have more sophisticated features like task prioritization, deadline alerts, and task sorting.

# Task that this project performs:
1)login/signup
2)Enter tasks
3)Do manipulation in tasks, example set priority to tasks, delete tasks, add more tasks etc.
4)After completing each task you will get points
5)In end your data of completed tasks will be saved in excel file.

# Implementation of Data Structures & Algorithms 
1)	Linked Lists: For organizing the task list to facilitate quick additions and removals.
2)	Priority Queues: To guarantee that the most crucial jobs are emphasized, manage task priority.
3)	Recursion: To ensure that the user enter the correct data otherwise the program will run again in order to make a loop until the correct data is not entered. 
4)	Stack: It will use to store and manipulate the data gathered from the user.
5)	Other Data Structures: To make the program more efficient by using some other data structures like Hash tables and many others.
6)	Sorting algorithms: These are used to arrange tasks according to various standards, like priorities and deadlines.

# Working of the code
1) Login/Sign up:
First user had to choose whether the user wants to Log in by using option 1 or want to sign up into the application by entering the option 2.
Login:
For Login the user had to enter his/her username and password is he enter wrong username and password then he will reenter the data until the data is not correct. It will all work using the algorithm of Recursion.
Sign up:
For sign up he had to enter or provide his/her username and password. Then user had to enter his/her age.

2) Write Tasks:
The user will write its tasks by entering the option 1 in the command option. The tasks that will enter by the user will be stored in the queue made out of linked list. The queue work on the principle of First In last out but in priority queue the code provide priority to the important tasks set by the user.

3) Deleting Tasks:
The tasks that are stored in the Priority queue. For deleting tasks user had to enter that he has completed that task or not. If he had completed that task his points will increase.

4) Set priority:
The user can set priorities of the tasks that he had entered in the queue. After selecting the task to prioritize that task will automatically get on the top.

5) Show all tasks:
It will display the tasks of the user that he had not completed yet. These tasks are stored in the Priority Queue. 

6) Show completed tasks:
The user can see the tasks that he has completed which are stored in the stack.

7) Show result:
In the end the result of the user will be displayed on the console which include total number of tasks and the tasks that are completed by the user. These result are stored first on the trees and then in the csv file.

8) Save result:
The results of the user are saved in the csv file.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, implementing a to-do list application using stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and linked lists offers a rich learning experience in handling various data structures. Successfully integrating these diverse structures results in a robust, scalable, and efficient to-do list application, showcasing the practical application of theoretical concepts. This project not only enhances technical skills but also prepares for tackling more complex software development tasks in the future.
